famous-mediator
===============

A design pattern that decouples modules using the mediator pattern.

## Getting started

Install using bower or npm

```bash
  bower install famous-mediator
  npm install famous-mediator
```

## Usage

The Famo.us Engine is used as a global eventbus to announce creation of modules.

If you want to register a module, simple call in your constructor function:

```javascript
  Engine.emit('created',this)
````

A module MUST have a name to be registered. This name can be found on:

- this.options.id = 'xxxx'
- this.options.name = 'xxxx'
- this.id = 'xxxx'
- this.name = 'xxxx'

The module with the name `xxxx` is accessible as follows:

```
  var Mediator = require('famous-mediator');
  Mediator.xxxx
  Engine.on('created:xxxx',function(xxxx){ .... });
```

The idea is to write Mediator singletons that couple modules together by:

- listening to the events they emit
- calling the public API
- triggering events on a module

For example, imagine you have a `Router` module and a `pages` module:

```
  var Mediator = require('famous-mediator');
  var Engine = require('famous/core/Engine');

  Engine.on('created:Router',function(router){
    router.on('change',function(name){
      Mediator.pages.set(name);
    });
  });
```
